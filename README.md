# NCC Digital Design Guide

## Requirements
The NCC Digital Design Guide is built upon [Fractal](https://github.com/frctl/fractal), a tool that enables the rapid development of components, templates and pages. Fractal uses a number of ES6 features, so this project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4.0+ to be installed locally. A global install of Gulp is also required.
